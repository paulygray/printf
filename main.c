Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.\n\nMost of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language (usually C ++ ), the explanation says so explicitly. If the description for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use that option with all supported languages.\n\nThe gcc program accepts options and file names as operands. Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options may not";
